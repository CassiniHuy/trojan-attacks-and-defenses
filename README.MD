# Backdoor attacks and defense

This repo is aimed to build a library containing codes of popular backdoor attacks and defenese. 
The main goal is to make the implementation simple and easy-to-use, meanwhile without learning how the code is writing.

Current codes containing:

- Defense: [SentiNet: Detecting Localized Universal Attacks Against Deep Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00292). I cannot found an official implementation.
- More attacks and defense: coming...

# Logs
